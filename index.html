                    <p>It is a well-known fact that the human knee has a limited lifetime. It can last for decades, but at some point, it will inevitably wear out and need to be replaced. To get the most from your knees before they require replacement, you should engage in pre-habilitation exercises regularly. By doing so, not only will you keep your knees healthy longer, but you'll also reduce the severity of pain during the surgery and have an easier time recovering afterward.<br><br>Pre-habilitation exercises were designed by physical therapists specifically to prepare patients for <a href="https://www.arthurfleemd.com/total-knee-replacement-surgery-in-cincinnati">knee replacement surgery</a> and help them recover afterward. They involve simple movements that are gentle on joints yet still effective at strengthening muscles around the knee area which may become weak after just one or two surgeries.</p>

            <h2>Pre-habilitation can help you recover faster</h2>
            <p>A hip replacement is a surgical procedure in which the diseased and painful hip joint is replaced with an artificial one. A total hip replacement includes replacing both the femoral head (the top of the thigh bone) and the acetabulum (a socket on the pelvis) . The new components are usually made of metal alloys, such as cobalt-chromium or titanium, but they can also be made of ceramic or polymer materials. A partial hip replacement replaces only part of these two joints. This surgery has many benefits including helping people regain their mobility that was lost due to aging, arthritis, injury, or other factors.
            </p>
            <h2>Pre-habilitation can help you battle surgical complications

            </h2>
            <p>In addition to quicker recovery times, people who opt for pre-hab will often find that they have fewer post-operative complications. That means less time spent at the hospital and a minimized risk of developing an infection or blood clots while your <a href="https://www.arthurfleemd.com/knee-fracture-surgery-in-cincinnati">knee is healing</a>. Blood clots are a major cause of death after surgery, so it’s always best to avoid them if possible. Since patients with weaker lower body muscles tend to be at higher risk for these problems, pre-hab may help reduce your odds of avoiding this dangerous scenario. Pre-hab also reduces pain after surgery because healthy muscle activity leads to increased blood flow and oxygen supply in surrounding tissues, which means your knee will be more comfortable after it’s been replaced.</p>

                    <h2>Pre-habilitation can help you recover faster with less pain</h2>
                    <p>To avoid complications and speed up recovery times, many patients choose a form of therapy before a surgery that will strengthen their muscles and ligaments as well as increase flexibility and range of motion. One such therapy is called pre-habilitation, which has been shown to improve the quality of life for those who have undergone <a href="https://www.arthurfleemd.com/total-knee-replacement-surgery-in-cincinnati">knee replacement</a> by enhancing the body’s ability to function after the procedure. The majority of patients who opt for this type of therapy experience very few post-operative issues like infections or blood clots. Patients also report lower levels of pain due to improved muscle function brought on by this form of therapy.
                    </p>

                <div>
                    <h2>Pre-habilitation can improve your overall experience</h2>
                    <p>Since pre-habilitation helps you recover faster, reduces the risk of many surgical complications, and minimizes postoperative pain, it’s safe to say that this type of therapy will also affect the overall quality of your life after knee replacement surgery. You may be able to return to work or perform daily activities in a more timely manner when you don’t have to spend time recovering from poorly prepared muscles and ligaments. Patients with stronger muscles report less pain than those with weaker muscle function due to better circulation causing less inflammation in surrounding tissue. Essentially, pre-hab can make for a much more positive experience when coupled with traditional rehabilitation exercises like stretching and strengthening.</p>

                    <h2>It reduces the risk of infection</h2>
                    <p>Nowadays, there are many advantages of pre-habilitating before the surgery. It is important to understand that this procedure is not only for the patients who have had a previous knee replacement surgery but also for those with other injuries or conditions. Pre-habilitation can be done in order to reduce the risk of infection and help you get back on your feet faster.</p>
                    <p>A few days after your surgery, you will start physical therapy. This will allow you to move around more easily and improve muscle function which might have been compromised by some type of injury or condition that required a knee replacement surgery in the first place. The goal is also to prevent any possible infections following the operation while at the same time encouraging blood flow by reducing swelling and pain.</p>

            <h2>You will need less time to recover after your surgery</h2>
            <p>As long as there are no complications during recovery, most patients who undergo a knee replacement surgery can be discharged after about 2-4 days, but those patients who pre-habilitated before their operation usually need less time to recover and return home. Pre-habilitation involves some very simple exercises which you should do every day at least two weeks before your surgery. These can include leg raises and moving the knee in different directions as well as standing up and sitting down repeatedly during the day. This will prepare your muscles for recovery and prevent infections by improving blood flow to the affected area.</p>
            <h2>It decreases your chances of having a blood clot or pneumonia</h2>
            <p>Pre-habilitation is the process of preparing for a surgery before it takes place. This can be done by doing things like getting your tissues to heal faster, strengthening muscles, and making sure that you are not overweight. The benefits of pre-habilitating before a knee replacement surgery include decreased chances of having blood clots or pneumonia post-surgery.</p>
            <p>Pre-habilitation starts about two weeks before the surgery date. One of the best ways to pre-habilitate is by eating a healthy diet and not overeating or eating highly processed foods. If you know that your knee replacement surgery is going to take place, make sure that you stop doing any heavy lifting exercises two weeks before your surgery date.</p>
            <p>Also, about one week before the surgery take an over-the-counter pain medication such as ibuprofen or acetaminophen that makes you feel comfortable during this time frame. This way it will help decrease any swelling in your knee and also increase blood flow towards your heart and away from your knee.</p>

            <h2>You'll be able to return home sooner and resume normal activities</h2>
            <p>The process of pre-habilitation before a knee replacement surgery is not an uncommon procedure. It's the standard of care for most patients with osteoarthritis in their knees. Pre-habilitation programs can help reduce pain and improve physical function - which means they may be able to speed up your recovery after surgery. In addition to getting back on your feet quicker, there are many other benefits to engaging in a pre-habilitation program before your knee replacement.
